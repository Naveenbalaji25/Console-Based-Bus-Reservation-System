# Console-Based-Bus-Reservation-System
Developed a console-based bus ticket reservation application using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java. Used encapsulation, constructors, and ArrayList to manage bus details and bookings dynamically. Implemented seat availability checks and booking validation to avoid overbooking; used Scanner for input and SimpleDateFormat for dates.
